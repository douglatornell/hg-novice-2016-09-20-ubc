~~~

To add the path of a local clone of a repository,

~~~

Clone a repository from a local path:

~~~ {.bash}

~~~

Note that when you clone a repository,
either by a URL or by a path,
the URL/path of the source repository is automatically added to the `[paths]` section of the new repository's `.hg/hgrc` file as the `default` path so that `hg push` and `hg pull` just work.
